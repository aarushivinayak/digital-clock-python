# digital-clock-python
This project is a digital clock implemented using Python's Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface. The clock displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds, along with an AM/PM indicator. The time is updated in real-time and is visually segmented into different sections with distinct background colors for each time unit.
